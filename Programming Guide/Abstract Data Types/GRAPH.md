# Graph Abstract Data Type
The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:

- Graph() creates a new, empty graph.
- addVertex(vert) adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
- addEdge(fromVert, toVert) Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
- addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
- getVertex(vertKey) finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
- getVertices() returns the list of all vertices in the graph.
- in returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise.
