# BizCod Knowledge 

BizCod programming language provides a powerful mechanism to capture and represent business knowledge. This representation comes in the form of Knowledge Base. Just like the data is captured in the data bases so is the knowledge captured in the knowledge base.



## Rules

Rule is a fundamental element of knowledge base. Rule processes the data and produce side-effects. Side efects are the results of rules applicationa to the data. 
Here is a formal definition of a rule

```js
  define 
    rule <rule-name"(<args>) 
      condition
        <logical-condition>
        
      action
        <instructions-block>
      
```

## Knowledge Base


```js
  define 
    rule asdasdsad(asdsad, asdsadsad, asdsadsa,asdasdas) 
      condition
        asdasd.asdsad > asdasdsad.asdsad or sadsadsad. asdasd = "123123123asdas" 
        
      action
        asdsadsad.asdasdsa = 12321.23432
      
```

```js
  define 
    ruleset asdasdasdsad
      facts 
        asdsad, asdsadsad, asdsad, asdasdsad
      rules 
        asdsadsad(asdsad, asdsad, asdsad)
        aSDSADSADSAD(ASDSAD,ASDSADASD)
      
```

```js

  define 
    knowledge-base FraudDetectionRules
      facts 
        asdasdsad Asadsad,  
        asdsadasda Hasdsadsad, 
        asdasdsad Adsafdsfdsfdsf
        
      rules 
      
        asdsadasdsad(asdasdsad, asdsadasda, asdasdsad
        
```
