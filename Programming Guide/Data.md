A data element is a container that stores the information. This information can take different forms (or be of certain types). For example it can store text, number or date. The data elements can be grouped together to form a coherent unit of information. 
This unit is called a class of data and the data elements that form this unit are called properties. Therefore, a class is a collection (grouping) of data properties.

As mentioned previously, the data properties are typed to represent different forms of data. To begin with and create a basic data type foundation, BizCod provides the types the are 'internally' defined. These internal types are called primitive types. The following table provides the basic primitive data types:Â 

| primitive data type                           | description   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID                             |  this data type stores a unique ID number. It is usually used for identification purpose to identify objects that are globally unique                    |
| Text                    | textual data to store the text such as 'John Roberts' 'commercial account' and so on                                          | 
| Number                     | number to store numbers such as 100, 3000. The number can be either positive or negative                                        | 
| Decimal                     | decimal data that are desiged to store decimal numbers such as 213213.45 , -24324.67                                          | 
| Date                     | to store then date                                      | 
| Logical                     | logical type that can be either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>                                        | 

Note that this table provides a partial list of data types only. 

Moving forward, let's provide a practical application of BizCod data model. We will use the Banking system to define the data model. 
Here we will define a Account class to hold the basic information about the account




```
define model Account
    id ID,
    name Text,
    accountType Text    
;
```
In simple terms, this BzCod statement translates into :
define a data model (class) Account that has id , name and account type properties. These properties are of different types (ID, Text and Text respectively) to represent different forms of data.
