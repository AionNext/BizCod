# BizCod Function


What is a function and what purpose does it server> In BizCod programming paradigm, the objective of function is to produce results by processing the input data called arguments. 
While procedure process the data as well, it is fundamentally different from function because it does not produc results

From conceptual standpoint, procedural logic is a set of instructions that the programmer can use (group) to process the data. Since these instructions perform different functions, they are of different types. Here are the basi types:
- assignment instructions
- conditional instructions
- procedure invocation instructions
